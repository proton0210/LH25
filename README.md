# Real Estate Platform: A Serverless Property Management Solution

## üíî The Problem We're Solving

*Looking for a new house for our growing family, we quickly discovered the real estate market's biggest pain points:*

**False and misleading listings everywhere.** Many online property listings contain inaccurate information, outdated photos, or properties that aren't even available.

**High brokerage fees.** Standard brokerage fees around 2% add significant costs to already expensive transactions.

**Missing critical data.** It's nearly impossible to find accurate square footage rates and capital appreciation data to make informed decisions.

**Lack of transparency.** The information you need to evaluate properties and neighborhoods simply isn't accessible or reliable.

After experiencing these frustrations firsthand, we built this platform to solve these fundamental issues in the real estate market.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Excellence in Serverless Design

This platform represents a state-of-the-art implementation of serverless architecture patterns on AWS, demonstrating best practices in event-driven design, microservices architecture, and cloud-native development. Built from personal experience with real estate market frustrations, it showcases how modern serverless applications can achieve enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, and performance while maintaining cost efficiency.

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a comprehensive real estate property management system built entirely on AWS serverless technologies. Born from the frustration of house hunting with unreliable data and high fees, the platform enables users to list properties with verified information, manage real estate portfolios, generate AI-powered property reports with accurate market data, and handle administrative workflows‚Äîall while leveraging the power of AWS Lambda and associated serverless services.

## üîß Lambda Architecture Deep Dive

### Function Organization
Our Lambda functions follow a clear organizational structure:

```
functions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appsync-resolvers/     # GraphQL resolver functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event-handlers/        # EventBridge event processors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ property-upload/       # Property submission pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queue-consumers/       # SQS message processors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report-generation/     # AI report pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ upgrade-user/          # User tier management
