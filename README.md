## The Problem We're Solving

*Looking for a new house for our growing family, we quickly discovered the real estate market's biggest pain points:*

**False and misleading listings everywhere.** Many online property listings contain inaccurate information, outdated photos, or properties that aren't even available.

**High brokerage fees.** Standard brokerage fees around 2% add significant costs to already expensive transactions.

**Missing critical data.** It's nearly impossible to find accurate square footage rates and capital appreciation data to make informed decisions.

**Lack of transparency.** The information you need to evaluate properties and neighborhoods simply isn't accessible or reliable.

After experiencing these frustrations firsthand, I built this platform to solve these fundamental issues in the real estate market.

## 🏗️ Architectural Excellence in Serverless Design

This platform represents a state-of-the-art implementation of serverless architecture patterns on AWS, demonstrating best practices in event-driven design, microservices architecture, and cloud-native development. Built from personal experience with real estate market frustrations, it showcases how modern serverless applications can achieve enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, and performance while maintaining cost efficiency.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a comprehensive real estate property management system built entirely on AWS serverless technologies. Born from the frustration of house hunting with unreliable data and high fees, the platform enables users to list properties with verified information, manage real estate portfolios, generate AI-powered property reports with accurate market data, and handle administrative workflows—all while leveraging the power of AWS Lambda and associated serverless services.

## 🔥 AWS Lambda Architecture

### Why Lambda?

AWS Lambda forms the backbone of our serverless architecture, providing:
- **Zero Server Management**: No infrastructure to provision or manage
- **Automatic Scaling**: From zero to thousands of concurrent executions
- **Pay-per-Use**: Charged only for compute time consumed
- **Event-Driven**: Seamlessly integrates with 20+ AWS services
- **High Availability**: Built-in fault tolerance across multiple AZs

### Lambda Functions Overview

Our application utilizes **25+ Lambda functions** organized into distinct categories:

```
📦 Lambda Functions (25+)
├── 🔐 Authentication & User Management (5)
├── 🏠 Property Management (8)
├── 🤖 AI & Report Generation (4)
├── 📧 Notifications & Events (4)
├── 🛠️ Utility Functions (4)
```

### Lambda Integration Patterns

#### 1. **Synchronous Request-Response Pattern**
Used for real-time operations through AWS AppSync GraphQL API:

```
User Request → AppSync → Lambda Resolver → DynamoDB → Response
```

**Example Functions:**
- `get-property`: Retrieves property details (128MB, 10s timeout)
- `list-properties`: Lists filtered properties (256MB, 30s timeout)
- `get-user-details`: Fetches user profile (128MB, 10s timeout)

#### 2. **Asynchronous Processing Pattern**
Used for time-intensive operations via SQS queues:

```
API Request → Lambda → SQS Queue → Lambda Consumer → Step Functions
```

**Example Flow:**
- `create-property` → SQS → `property-upload-consumer` → Step Functions workflow

#### 3. **Event-Driven Pattern**
Used for reactive processing via EventBridge:

```
State Change → EventBridge → Lambda Handler → Action
```

**Example Functions:**
- `property-approved-handler`: Sends notification when admin approves property
- `property-rejected-handler`: Notifies user of rejection with reasons

#### 4. **Step Functions Orchestration Pattern**
Used for complex multi-step workflows:

```
Step Functions → Lambda 1 → Lambda 2 → Lambda 3 → Complete
```

**Example Workflows:**
- User Creation: `generate-user-id` → `create-dynamodb-user` + `create-s3-folder` → `send-welcome-email`
- Report Generation: `generate-ai-content` → `generate-pdf` → `save-to-s3` → `send-email`

## 📋 How AWS Lambda Was Used

### AppSync Resolvers (GraphQL API Endpoints)
- **`create-property`** - Validates property data and queues it for asynchronous processing via SQS
- **`get-property`** - Retrieves single property details from DynamoDB with authorization checks

- **`list-my-properties`** - Fetches properties owned by the authenticated user using GSI queries
- **`get-user-details`** - Returns user profile information with role-based access control
- **`get-upload-url`** - Generates secure S3 presigned URLs for direct file uploads
- **`approve-property`** - Admin function to approve pending properties and trigger notifications
- **`reject-property`** - Admin function to reject properties with reason tracking
- **`update-property`** - Modifies existing property data with ownership validation
- **`delete-property`** - Removes property and associated resources with authorization
- **`list-pending-properties`** - Admin-only function to retrieve properties awaiting approval
- **`generate-property-report`** - Initiates AI-powered property analysis for paid users

- **`save-property-to-dynamodb`** - Stores validated property data with multiple GSI keys
- **`send-pending-approval-notification`** - Notifies admins of new properties to review
- **`generate-ai-content`** - Invokes Bedrock Claude model for property analysis
- **`generate-pdf`** - Converts AI analysis into formatted PDF report
